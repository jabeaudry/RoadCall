# RoadCall
A proximity chat application for truckers to fight boredom and stay awake, using `Typescript`, `Express.js`, `Node.js` and `MySQL`.

## About the Project
Around 20% of vehicle collisions occur due to fatigue in Canada. Truckers are especially vulnerable with their hectic schedules. Additionally, truck drivers can often spend days with little to no interaction with others. The dullness can be dangerous.   
RoadChat directly addresses these issues by providing exciting conversations, at any time of a commute. Drivers get to connect when they are driving closeby and share a common experience. They may work for different companies and have different backgrounds, but they share a common journey.   
## How it Works

The interface is not meant to be looked at during the drive. Before starting their vehicles, the driver may connect to RoadChat. While they drive, the screen will turn to blue if they connect with a nearby driver. As long as they remain close, the drivers may share anecdotes and even help keep each other awake!
